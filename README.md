# Wave Portal Project

This is a sample project from [buildspace](https://zip.sc/WxSOM). Here, I created a web app where we can send a wave to another person. And the message will be saved into the blockchain.

I used Hardhat to help me create a local Ethereum network, and gives some basic testing environment for this app.

## Retrieve Auto-Generated Ethereum Address

```shell
npx hardhat accounts

## How to Build The Project
